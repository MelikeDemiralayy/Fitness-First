       Yoga is a centuries-old practice that originated in ancient India. The word comes from Sanskrit, a traditional Indian language, and means ‘to join together’. It focuses on the combination of mind, body, and spirit through physical postures, breathing exercises, and meditation.

While yoga has long been associated with cultural and spiritual traditions, the health benefits are even more widely known today. Everyone, from celebrities to footballers, are getting involved in yoga classes to improve their flexibility, recovery time, and mental well-being, regardless of beliefs or lifestyle.

We’ve created a list of benefits to show you why more people than ever are giving yoga a go and how you can reap the benefits for yourself as a beginner.  The International Day of Yoga takes place on the 21st of June each year and aims to raise awareness of the health benefits of this practice. This significant event is officially recognised by the U.N. and has been running for 10 years. During the day, people around the world are encouraged to take part in a yoga class — whether they are experiencing yoga for the first time or have been practising for several years

        Men’s Health Week is dedicated to raising awareness about health issues commonly affecting boys and men. The aim is to give them access to information, services, and treatments so they can live healthy and fulfilling lives.
  
        Tim Andrews, Head of Fitness Product at Fitness First explains: “Men’s Health Week is a powerful platform that aims to empower men around the UK to take pride and prioritise their mental and physical wellbeing. We’re all guilty of not putting ourselves first or taking the proper time to check when something doesn’t feel right.”
  
        Essentially, Men’s Health Week isn’t just about medical health; it also focuses on improving our mental well-being and fostering an open conversation about topics often considered taboo among men. Men’s Health Week began in 1994 in the United States. It was introduced due to a bill aimed at increasing awareness of preventable health issues and encouraging early detection and treatment of disease among men and boys. This eventually gained traction and soon became an international event celebrated worldwide.

        Whether you’re trying to gain muscle or simply tone up, when you’re just starting out on your fitness journey, it can be tough to know exactly what you should and shouldn’t be eating to reach your goals.
  
        This is particularly important when you’re including protein in the mix — which is why our expert personal trainers at Fitness First have answered the most important questions about protein and gym nutrition to help you on your fitness journey. Protein is an important component of a healthy diet and is often an essential building block to muscle growth.
  
        “Protein is made up of 20 amino acids, which the body uses for building and repairing bones and muscle fibres and acts as carriers of nutrients and oxygen in your bloodstream.” It’s responsible for the foundation of trillions of cells that the human body is made up of, with one of the three macronutrients being used as an energy source. They also act as messengers in the form of enzymes that aid biochemical reactions such as digestion, muscle contraction, and energy production.

        We all live busy lives, and sometimes, finding the time to exercise doesn’t always go as planned. But this is where habit stacking can take your routine to the next level.
  
        Written by S. J. Scott, ‘Habit Stacking: 97 Small Life Changes That Take Five Minutes or Less’, the concept is simple: add a new habit to your current habit to create a ‘stack’ and watch your life shift for the better.
  
        In this Fitness First guide, we’ll walk you through everything there is to know about habit stacking and fitness and how you can easily incorporate these new habits into your daily life. Habit stacking is a strategy used by some fitness enthusiasts where you ‘stack’ a new habit onto an existing one. This aims to create simple, manageable and repetitive actions that don’t seem too overwhelming and contribute to your overall fitness goal.
